## BRANCH addlevel (by Alain -snowgoon88 AT gmail DOT com) ##############
'mapedit' is a small program to easily add new underworld or underdeep
          levels to an existing game.

It takes a 'game.in' and offers an interactive menu to
   - display the current world
   - add underworld if no underdeep already exists
   - add underdeep
   - shuffle the newly created gates
   - save into 'game.out'

If an there is an existing abyss level, it is pushed up to make room for the
new levels.
